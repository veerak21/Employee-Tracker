# Project Title: Employee-Tracker

## Description: 
This is a command line application that allows a user to manage information on employees within a company. The application connects to a database through MySQL that contains three tables with information on the departments, roles, and employees within the company. This Content Management System allows a user to add, view, and modify information about the employees of a company.

## Installation:
 This application runs through Node.js. It needs the Inquirer package (version 8.2.4) to interact with the user via the command line and is installed using `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` command. MySQL2 package connects to the MySQL database and performs queries. It is installed using `npm i mysql2` command. The console.table package prints MySQL rows to the console and is installed using `npm i console.table` command.

 ## Usage:
   The application can be invoked using a `node index.js` command. The user will be prompted to view all the departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, update an employee's current role, update an employee's current manager, remove an employee, remove a department, remove a role, and get the total salary for a specific department. After executing any of the add, update, or remove functions, the database is updated automatically.
